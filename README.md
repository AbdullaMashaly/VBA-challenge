# VBA-challenge

This project is part of an assignment that focuses on using VBA scripting to analyze stock market data. The script loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:

- Ticker symbol
- Yearly change from the opening price to the closing price
- Percentage change from the opening price to the closing price
- Total stock volume

The script also includes functionality to highlight positive changes in green and negative changes in red using conditional formatting. Additionally, it returns the stocks with the greatest percentage increase, greatest percentage decrease, and greatest total volume.

**##Steps:**

1. I Created a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:
  -The ticker symbol
  -Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
  -The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
  -The total stock volume of the stock.

2. Added functionality to script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume".
3. Made the appropriate adjustments to VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once.
